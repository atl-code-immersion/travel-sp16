Travel App!

We worked on this app for the bulk of our first week of Rails (third week of class).

We looked at passing data as instance variables from the controller to the views, through query strings, and use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) with database tables.

On the front end, we got used to using Bootstrap for our layouts.

Finally, we added the Google Maps API to our app.
